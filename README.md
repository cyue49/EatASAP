# Eat ASAP

### Description

---

This project is the final project for the Client-side and Server-side Web Programming course at John Abbott College. 

The idea of Eat ASAP is an online menu ordering service for restaurants customers using QR codes. The website is intented to be used by two types of users, restaurant owners and customers. Restaurants sign up on the website to display their menus, allowing customers to order. Customers arrive at the specific restaurant's ordering page by scanning the respective QR code of the restaurant. 

Restaurant owners need to sign up to use the website to display their menu. On the restaurant profile page, they can edit their personal information, the restaurant information, and the restaurant menu. 

Customers can order with or without an account. If they have an account, they can quick checkout without having to reenter their information and they can keep track of their order history at the customer profile page.
